# Python-Database-Connectivity
This Python script connects to a MySQL database and performs CRUD operations on a "Player" table. It includes functions to insert, display, search, update, and delete records. The code uses context managers for safe cursor handling, input validation, and structured error handling to ensure a robust and maintainable database interaction.
